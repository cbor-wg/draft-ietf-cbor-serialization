Moreover, NaN-boxing is not reducible to only-pointers. Wording in -01 in parenteses is OK, though.",

      "body": "There are in my opinion three main reasons for using deterministic encoding (DE):\n- Having  DE as the only _encoding_ mode relives users from having to deal with serialization options.  That is, DE is not only about the needs of applications.  \"Most applications etc.\" may not be valid forever.\n- DE enables applications to hash and sign \"raw\" CBOR, including sending the \"raw\" CBOR data on-the-wire:\nhttps://github.com/cyberphone/D-CBOR/blob/main/README.md#example\nI get the impression that the draft intends to outlaw, alternatively ignore this use case.  Is this correct?\n- DE (unlike the application-level) enables full equivalence:\nhttps://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-rundgren-cbor-core-19.html#name-application-vs-encoding-lev\nI use this feature extensively in JUnit tests and for test vector generation.\n\n**Decoder**\nThe sub-section about _decoder_ requirements outlines a specific policy.  The Blockchain Commons' dCBOR implementations as well as my CBOR::Core implementations use another policy (full DE compliance checking).   The CBOR::Core implementations deal with decoder policies in a more useful way than imagined by the serialization draft:\nhttps://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-rundgren-cbor-core-19.html#name-backward-compatibility\n\n**COSE**\nThe section about COSE does not explain why the payload does not depend on DE.  Since this topic is causing controversy, it might be useful adding the fact that the payload is wrapped in \"bstr\".\n\n**dCBOR**\nThe only publicly stated rationale for dCBOR (https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor-15.html), is to relieve developers from having to separate certain instances of integers and floating-point numbers.  Saving bytes is not a part of the plot.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am (for obvious reasons) not going to bring up these topics on the CBOR mailing list yet another time:\nhttps://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cbor/w-Je-JwM1iI2VSLEcs9uCUt43_g/\n\nEven the use of URLs as object identifiers (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-rundgren-cotx/) has been dismissed although it is a de-facto standard in the JSON world including in the giant project known as \"Verified Credentials\".\n\nCBOR is about to change: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michael-kisilenko-ceo_nasa-with-4kb-to-the-moon-my-64gb-one-activity-7406052352618737665-ZVVi/\n\nAnders",

This adds a lot of text making it hard to read.  I also believe that quite a bit of this is rather \"esoteric\".\n\n|That is, if the WG wants to create a \"CBOR Design Guide\" they should of course do that but mixing that with (fairly) straightforward encoding rules, is not _my_ cup of tea.|\n|---|\n\nYou may remove me as contributor.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nRegarding dCBOR, I believe the two **algorithms** (transformations) _could_ have a value as _application-level_ (ALDR) standards, while the specific application of these as described in https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor-15.html seems less suitable as a standard.  The rationale mentioned in the dCBOR draft has nothing in common with related information in the 01 serialization draft.",

With the reverse bits solution preferred serialization does not interfere.\r\n\r\nAccording to Carsten, NaNboxing is as applicable to CBOR as computing square roots:\r\nhttps://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cbor/vCwXUg5FQfGvpsfcJ9pynn6O8bg/",
